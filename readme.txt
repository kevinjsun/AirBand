To Run:

Make sure you have a Leapmotion connected to your computer.  I think we use version 2.0.

Make sure to import all of the contents of this folder.  If you are missing things, the program
may not work properly.

Open up command prompt.  This program is only tested to run for WINDOWS at the moment.  8.1 should 
work for sure.

Navigate to the directory of this file.

Type in
$java -classpath "LeapJava.jar;." Sample

Enjoy!
